This project implements a simulation in the Copacabana District in Rio de Janeiro.
The simulation involves the spreading of the COVID-19 disease.

This simulation has a lot of places, so it takes quite some memory.
Either reduce the cache size in the Siafu configuration, or increase the memory
avaialble to your JVM by running it with -Xmx400M, for instance.
